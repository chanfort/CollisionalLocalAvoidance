1. Hash-based local avoidance system used in this project was extracted from Unite Austin Technical Presentation project (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UniteAustinTechnicalPresentation) in order to obtain stress tests and compare performance. The code has been modified to meet the needs for stress testing.
